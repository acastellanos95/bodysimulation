# The problem

How many times newton's laws of classic dynamics have been discused in a common high school class? Many times of course, but the professor never explain its strengths when dealing with real life problems.

The reality we perceive with our senses in many ways is tipically a classic dynamics problem. Today I'm going to demonstrate you physics, math and computer lover a real visualization of how our universe works... really, how planets move in a visually way.

If you're in high school level don't worry to much about the coding part. If you're a bachelor student in sciences you better pay attention to this because is amazing how our solar system works and how newton's laws with help of a computer give life to this video you're a seeing.

First of all, we begin the discussion of the problem with newton's first law. The inertia rule, a body will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless we change its state with the action of other force. This law is important for basic concept in physics but not for our visualization.

Then we have the Newton's second law of motion
